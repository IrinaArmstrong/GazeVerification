    """
    The Savitzky Golay filter is a particular type of low-pass filter, well adapted for data smoothing.

    The idea of Savitzky-Golay filters is simple â€“ for each sample in the filtered sequence,
    take its direct neighborhood of N neighbors and fit a polynomial to it.
    Then just evaluate the polynomial at its center (and the center of the neighborhood), point 0,
    and continue with the next neighborhood.

    Also Savitzky-Golay filters producing smoothened signal gradients / derivatives.
    The main point of Savitzky-Golay gradients is to compute the derivative at a given point,
    simply by computing the derivative of the fitted polynomial.

    Those filters are useful for filtering out the noise when the frequency span of the signal is large.
    They are reported to be optimal for minimizing the least-square error
    in fitting a polynomial to frames of the noisy data.
