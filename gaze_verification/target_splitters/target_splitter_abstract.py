    Provides enumeration for specific dataset splitting schemas:
    - like in [1]: Divide the entire data set by participant as follows - 25% into the test sample,
        another 25% into the validation sample and the remaining 50% into the training sample.
        This does not take into account the time period of recording sessions.
    - like in [2]: Divide the whole dataset by participants in a similar way to the previous method.
        At the stage of splitting the test sample into template and authentication records,
        take into account the time period of recording sessions - authentication records
        are collected severely lagged behind the template records by some time delta T.
